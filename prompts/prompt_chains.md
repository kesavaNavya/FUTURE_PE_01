### Step 1: Title Generation
I chose the niche "productivity and study techniques" could you generate the titles that are catchy and implies the content.

### Step 2: Script Generation
Now generate the script for the title (Why Hard Work Isn’t Improving Your Grades)  which contains about 800-1500 words.

### Step 3: Thumbnail Image
Generate a thumbnail for a youtube video which should be realistic and attractive whose miche is study and the study methods and motivation.

### step 4: complete video 
i used pictory to complete the video. i uploaded the script and generated the video first then i added the AI generated voice over to form a complete video. that's it

## title -- chatgpt
## script -- chatgpt
## video generation -- pictory
## thumbail -- gemini ai

### THE WORK FLOW:
